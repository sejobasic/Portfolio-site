# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO V1

#### This is my first personal portfolio and is one of the top projects I am most proud of building, having the creative freedom to make it look however I wanted was both challenging and fun. I enjoyed getting into a React animation library called Framer Motion and learning about animating components and pieces to make my site more interactive.
#### I learned about a library called intersection observer that allowed me to render the animation only while in view on the page using their useInView hook in React. Overall it was just fun putting all the pieces together, selecting my own typography, colors etc. I even added a few sound effects to certain buttons that made it a bit more enjoyable. I definitely learned a ton during the process and sharpened my React skills. 
#### One challenge i faced was making my dark mode switch persist if the user refreshes the page, after some research and dabbling, I eventually figured out that you can use local storage to store the current state of the switch in react and that would allow the background color to persist.
