# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO V1

#### This is my first personal portfolio and is one of the top projects I am most proud of building, having the creative freedom to make it look however I wanted was both challenging and fun. I enjoyed getting into a React animation library called Framer Motion and learning about animating components and pieces to make my site more interactive.
#### I learned about a library called intersection observer that allowed me to render the animation only while in view on the page using their useInView hook in React. Overall it was just fun putting all the pieces together, selecting my own typography, colors etc. I even added a few sound effects to certain buttons that made it a bit more enjoyable. I definitely learned a ton during the process and sharpened my React skills.
